# Agent Handoff Document - Llamafile Modernization

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Current Agent:** Claude (Session 1)  
**Next Agent:** TBD  
**Project:** Llamafile + Cosmocc 4.0.2 Modernization

---

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Agent

### You Are Here
- **Progress:** 85% complete
- **What Works:** Core llama.cpp compiles with cosmocc 4.0.2
- **What's Left:** Fix ~20 compilation errors in chatbot wrapper code
- **Estimated Time:** 4-8 hours to completion

### Immediate Action
```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/seb/.cursor/worktrees/llamafile/E19A7

# 2. Check current build status
gmake -j4 2>&1 | grep "error:" | wc -l

# 3. Read priority docs:
# - COMPLETION_STATUS.md (what's done)
# - NEXT_STEPS_AGENT_GUIDE.md (what to do)
# - API_MIGRATION_QUICK_REF.md (API cheat sheet)

# 4. Start with AGENT TASK 2 (trivial, 5 min)
# Then move to AGENT TASK 1 (critical, 2-3 hr)
```

## 📊 Project State Snapshot

### Build Status
```
✅ COMPILING (85%):
- Third-party libraries (mbedtls, sqlite, stb, etc.)
- GGML core (ggml/src/*.c, ggml/src/*.cpp)
- Llama implementation (src/*.cpp)  
- Common utilities (common/*.cpp)
- Core llamafile (most files)
- Highlight system
- Most chatbot components

❌ BLOCKED (~20 errors):
- llamafile/chatbot_main.cpp (~18 errors)
- llamafile/compute.cpp (1 error)
- Possibly server files (not yet attempted)
```

### Files Modified So Far
- **Config:** `build/config.mk` (cosmocc version)
- **Build System:** 8 BUILD.mk files created
- **Sources:** ~60 files with include path updates
- **API Updates:** cuda.c, metal.c, chatbot_*.cpp, server/*.cpp
- **Docs:** 4 markdown files created

### Git Status
- Working tree should be clean (from user's session start)
- Branch: `main`
- Remote: upstream/main (mozilla-ai/llamafile)

---

## 🎯 Priority Task Queue

### IMMEDIATE (Do First)
1. ✅ **AGENT TASK 2:** Fix `compute.cpp` include (5 min)
2. ✅ **AGENT TASK 1:** Fix `chatbot_main.cpp` API (2-3 hr)
3. ✅ **AGENT TASK 3:** Complete build (1-2 hr)

**Why:** These unblock compilation. Cannot proceed without them.

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do Second)
4. ✅ **AGENT TASK 7:** Test basic functionality (1-2 hr)

**Why:** Validates the work so far. Critical before investing more time.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Do Third)
5. ⏸️ **AGENT TASK 8:** Performance benchmarking (1-2 hr)
6. ⏸️ **AGENT TASK 4:** Server API migration (2-3 hr)
7. ⏸️ **AGENT TASK 6:** Update CI (30 min)

**Why:** Important for production readiness, but not blocking.

### LOW PRIORITY (Do Last)
8. ⏸️ **AGENT TASK 5:** Multimodal (mtmd) migration (4-6 hr)

**Why:** Feature addition, not blocking core functionality.

---

## 🔑 Critical Information

### Build Tool
**MUST use `gmake` not `make`**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG (macOS make is too old):
make -j4

# ✅ CORRECT:
gmake -j4
```

### Current Errors Count
Last build: **~20 errors**
- 18 in chatbot_main.cpp
- 1 in compute.cpp
- Unknown in server/* (not yet reached)

### Known Working Commands
```bash
# Build single file (for testing):
gmake o//llamafile/chatbot_main.o V=1

# Build chatbot component:
gmake o//llamafile/chatbot

# Full build:
gmake -j4

# Clean build:
gmake clean && gmake -j4
```

## 📖 Essential Reading for Next Agent

### Must Read (15 min)
1. **COMPLETION_STATUS.md** - Overall status
2. **NEXT_STEPS_AGENT_GUIDE.md** → **AGENT TASK 1** section
3. **API_MIGRATION_QUICK_REF.md** - For API lookups

### Should Read (30 min)
4. **SPEC.txt** - Original requirements
5. **MODERNIZATION_PROGRESS.md** - Detailed progress log

### Reference When Needed
6. **llama.cpp/include/llama.h** - API authority
7. **llama.cpp/common/common.h** - Helper functions
8. **llama.cpp/tools/main/main.cpp** - Reference implementation

---

## 🔨 Common Commands You'll Need

### Building
```bash
# Clean
gmake clean

# Build with errors visible
gmake -j4 2>&1 | tee build.log

# Build single file
gmake o//path/to/file.o

# See compile command
gmake o//path/to/file.o V=1
```

### Searching
```bash
# Find function in llama.cpp
grep -r "function_name" llama.cpp/include/

# Find struct definition  
grep -r "struct name" llama.cpp/

# Find usage example
grep -r "function_name" llama.cpp/tools/main/

# Find all API changes
grep "DEPRECATED" llama.cpp/include/llama.h
```

### Testing (after build works)
```bash
# Create test llamafile
cp o//llama.cpp/main/main test.llamafile
o//llamafile/zipalign -j0 \
  test.llamafile \
  models/TinyLLama-v0.1-5M-F16.gguf

# Test it
chmod +x test.llamafile
./test.llamafile -e -p "Hello" -n 10 -ngl 0
```

## 🐛 Most Likely Next Errors

Based on patterns so far, expect to see:

### In chatbot_main.cpp
- Missing helper functions (add includes)
- Params struct member changes (check common_params definition)
- Sampling API incompatibility (biggest challenge)
- Model/context initialization changes
- Server integration issues (recommend stubbing out)

### In compute.cpp
- Simple include path fix

### After Those
- Server components may have similar issues
- Tools might need wrapper updates
- Whisper.cpp and stable-diffusion.cpp may need minor fixes

---

## 💡 Tips for Efficient Work

### Pattern Recognition
Once you fix one API change, the same pattern appears multiple times:
- Fix `llama_token_bos` once → apply to `_eos`, `_nl`, etc.
- Fix sampling in one file → apply to others
- Fix memory API in one place → replicate elsewhere

### Incremental Approach
1. Fix **one** file completely
2. Try building it: `gmake o//path/to/file.o`
3. Move to next file
4. Don't fix everything at once - too error-prone

### Use Examples
llama.cpp/tools/main/main.cpp is gold:
- Shows correct API usage
- Up-to-date with latest llama.cpp
- Copy patterns from there

### When Unsure
**Stub it out and move on:**
```cpp
// TODO: Update this function - API changed
// Old implementation disabled for now
return default_value;
```
Better to have a building system with some features disabled than nothing at all.

## 💾 State Preservation

### If you need to stop mid-session
```bash
# Save current progress
git status
# Note which files are modified

# Document in handoff
echo "## Current Work" >> AGENT_HANDOFF.md
echo "- Fixed: X, Y, Z" >> AGENT_HANDOFF.md
echo "- In Progress: A (50% done)" >> AGENT_HANDOFF.md  
echo "- Blocked by: B issue" >> AGENT_HANDOFF.md
echo "- Next: Start with C" >> AGENT_HANDOFF.md
```

### Critical State to Preserve
- What you were working on
- What's half-fixed (might break if interrupted)
- Any research findings (where functions moved, etc.)
- Error count before/after your work

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

Track these as you work:

```bash
# Error count
gmake -j4 2>&1 | grep "error:" | wc -l
# Target: 0

# Warning count  
gmake -j4 2>&1 | grep "warning:" | wc -l
# Target: <100 (deprecation warnings acceptable)

# Build time
time gmake -j4
# Baseline: Unknown (measure first successful build)

# Binary size
ls -lh o//llama.cpp/main/main
# Target: Reasonable (<50MB for main binary)
```

## 📚 Knowledge Base

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Server Integration:** Temporarily disabled in chatbot_main.cpp
   - Can be re-enabled once core chatbot works
   - Commented out with clear TODOs

2. **Image/Multimodal:** Stubbed out with error messages
   - Needs full mtmd API migration
   - Deferred to later phase
   - Clear TODOs added

3. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintained for critical APIs
   - cuda.c has compat struct for `ggml_cuda_device_properties`
   - metal.c has stubs for removed functions
   - Allows localscore to still compile

4. **Batch API:** Using simplified `llama_batch_get_one`
   - Auto position tracking
   - Simpler than manual management

### Open Questions
1. **Sampling API:** Exact initialization sequence unclear
   - Need to reference main.cpp example
   - `sparams` member missing from common_params

2. **Model Params:** How to create from common_params?
   - Old: `llama_model_params_from_gpt_params`
   - New: Research needed

3. **Server Integration:** How much changed?
   - Not investigated yet
   - May need substantial work

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### For Next Agent Starting Now:

**Step 1:** Fix compute.cpp (5 minutes)
```bash
# Open file
nano llamafile/compute.cpp

# Find the error line (~24)
# Likely: #include "llama.cpp/string.h"

# Check what it should be:
ls llama.cpp/common/*.h | grep string
# Or maybe it should be llamafile/string.h

# Update and test:
gmake o//llamafile/compute.o
```

**Step 2:** Start chatbot_main.cpp (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Open file
nano llamafile/chatbot_main.cpp

# Get error list
gmake o//llamafile/chatbot_main.o 2>&1 | grep "error:"

# Fix systematically:
# 1. Add missing includes
# 2. Update function calls
# 3. Fix params access
# 4. Update sampling API
# 5. Test compile after each major fix
```

**Step 3:** Complete build
```bash
# After chatbot_main.cpp fixed:
gmake -j4

# Fix any remaining errors
# Should be mostly similar patterns
```

**Step 4:** Create test llamafile
```bash
# Follow instructions in AGENT TASK 7
# Validate basic text generation works
```
