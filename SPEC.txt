# Llamafile Modernization Specification Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the modernization of llamafile by integrating the latest versions of its core dependencies: **ggml-org/llama.cpp** (upstream) and **cosmocc-4.0.2** (Cosmopolitan Libc compiler). The objective is to produce a modern, portable llamafile build that supports all contemporary model architectures while maintaining llamafile's exceptional performance characteristics and cross-platform portability.

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 What is Llamafile?

Llamafile is a revolutionary approach to distributing and running Large Language Models (LLMs) that combines:

- **Single-file executables**: Weights + inference engine in one portable binary
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD without modification
- **Zero dependencies**: No CUDA SDK, ROCm, or runtime libraries required
- **Exceptional performance**: 2-5x faster than standard llama.cpp for many workloads
- **Universal GPU support**: Both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs work out-of-the-box via tinyBLAS

### 1.2 Why Llamafile is Architecturally Interesting

Llamafile achieves its portability through **Cosmopolitan Libc** (cosmocc), which produces "Actually Portable Executable" (APE) binaries. These executables contain multiple platform implementations in a single file that self-extracts and runs on any supported OS.

The key innovations include:

1. **Custom matrix multiplication kernels** optimized for LLM-specific patterns
2. **Architectural-specific optimizations** that auto-detect and utilize CPU capabilities
3. **Platform-agnostic GPU support** via tinyBLAS
4. **Zero-install philosophy** that makes LLM deployment trivial

---

## 2. Current State vs. Target State

### 2.1 Current State (Out of Date)

- **llamafile**: Using outdated llama.cpp fork
- **ggml-org/llama.cpp**: Multiple architecture updates and model support additions since last sync
- **cosmocc**: Previous version (pre-4.0.2) with potential compatibility issues
- **Missing features**: Recent model architectures (Llama 3, Gemma 2, Phi-3, Qwen2, etc.)

### 2.2 Target State (Modernized)

**Component Versions:**
- **ggml-org/llama.cpp**: Latest main branch (includes all modern architectures)
- **cosmocc**: 4.0.2 (latest stable release)
- **Build system**: Updated to work with both components seamlessly

**Expected Capabilities:**
- Support for all modern model architectures (Llama 3.x, Mistral, Mixtral, Gemma, Phi, Qwen, etc.)
- Latest quantization formats (Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M, Q6_K, IQ variants)
- Updated KV cache implementations
- Flash Attention 2 support where applicable
- Latest rope scaling and context extension techniques

## 3. Performance Characteristics (Why This Matters)

### 3.1 Speed Improvements

Llamafile delivers exceptional performance through custom optimizations:

**Benchmark Results:**
- **2-5x faster** CPU execution for Mixture of Experts models
- **30% faster** F16 performance on Intel Skylake
- **60% faster** on Apple M2
- **20% faster** on Raspberry Pi 5
- **2x speedup** for prompt processing on Skylake systems
- **2.8x faster** on AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO 7995WX

**Specific Improvements:**
- Prompt processing: 30% to 500% faster with F16 and Q8_0 weights on CPU
- Core i9-9900 using Q4_0 Mistral 7B: 65% higher prompt performance

### 3.2 Technical Magic Behind the Speed

#### 3.2.1 Custom Matrix Multiplication Kernels

**The Problem:**
- Matrix multiplication (GGML_OP_MUL_MAT) consumes 95% of processing time
- Standard BLAS libraries are designed for general use, not LLM-specific patterns
- Traditional approaches don't exploit LLM computation patterns

**The Solution - Unrolling Outer Loops:**

Llamafile implements **84 new matrix multiplication kernels** that unroll outer loops instead of inner loops. This approach:

- Exploits instruction-level parallelism with fewer memory references
- Shares register loads across multiple floating-point operations
- Dramatically reduces memory bandwidth requirements
- Achieves **810 gigaflops** on Intel i9-14900K vs Intel MKL's 295 gigaflops

**Key Insight:** When computing multiple output cells, the same input value is reused for multiple calculations through a vectorized outer product approach.

#### 3.2.2 LLM-Specific Optimizations

Llamafile exploits patterns unique to LLMs:
- Alpha/beta parameters are always 1 and 0
- Matrix A is almost always transposed
- m/k dimensions are usually divisible by 64

By removing unnecessary generality, performance improves dramatically for the specific LLM use case.

#### 3.2.3 tinyBLAS for GPU Support

A highly efficient linear algebra library for both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs that:
- Works out-of-the-box without CUDA SDK or ROCm installation on Windows
- Provides unified interface for multiple GPU vendors
- Integrates seamlessly with cosmopolitan binaries

#### 3.2.4 Platform-Specific Optimizations

Different kernels optimized for:
- **ARMv8.2+** with dotprod and fp16 support (Raspberry Pi 5)
- **Intel Alderlake** microarchitecture
- **AVX512** for AMD Zen 4
- Auto-detection ensures optimal kernel selection at runtime

#### 3.2.5 Efficiency Core Avoidance

On Intel chips with efficiency cores (P+E core designs), llamafile specifically avoids running on E-cores, preventing the lockstep thread dispatch from being slowed by weaker cores.

## 7. Technical Considerations for Smooth Compilation

### 7.1 Cosmopolitan Libc Specifics

**What Makes Cosmocc Special:**
- Produces "Actually Portable Executable" format

- Leverage cosmo's built-in platform abstractions
- Test binary on all target platforms before release

### 7.2 Performance Preservation Checklist

To ensure llamafile's performance advantages are maintained:

- [ ] Verify all 84 custom matrix kernels compile correctly
- [ ] Test runtime kernel selection on each CPU architecture
- [ ] Confirm outer-loop unrolling optimizations are preserved
- [ ] Validate tinyBLAS integration for GPU support
- [ ] Test efficiency core avoidance on Intel 12th+ gen
- [ ] Benchmark against both old llamafile and stock llama.cpp
- [ ] Profile with `perf` to identify any new hotspots
- [ ] Verify vectorized operations use optimal instructions

### 7.3 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't break portability:** Avoid platform-specific code outside detection wrappers
2. **Preserve custom kernels:** Don't accidentally overwrite llamafile's optimized implementations
3. **Test quantization formats:** Ensure all formats work, especially new IQ variants
4. **GPU support:** Don't break the zero-install GPU capability
5. **Binary size:** Keep executable size reasonable (balance between size and included optimizations)
6. **Backward compatibility:** Ensure older GGUF models still load
